# Hayagriva Converter

This is a tool to convert RIS files to Hayagriva format.

## Usage

```bash
$ hc <input-file> [output-file]
```

If `output-file` is omitted, the converted file will be named as the input file with the extension `.yaml`.

## Notes

Not many input fields are supported yet.
Double-check the exported file to make sure it's correct.
Some fields have to be manually populated.
